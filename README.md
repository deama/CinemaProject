#This is the README for the Scala QA Cinema website project

We completed this project using the Play framework and the Scala, HTML, CSS and Javascript languages.

All you need to run this website is an IDE (we used IntelliJ), or alternatively we could host the website remotely and thus you would be able to access it through a web address.

The members of this team were Dmytro Lysak (Team Leader), Blake Ezechi, Deng Nyuar, Leeroy Chiweshe and James Williams.
